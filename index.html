        <p class="para"><b>Like traditional sports, many people realize the inherent benefits and advantages of Esports. These
                benefits and advantages are a unique combination of health benefits, social benefits, and skills
                development, all of which can be accessed by people of varying physical capabilities.
                Whether you are an active player or simply a fan of Esports and their communities, there are many
                benefits and advantages one can enjoy by interacting with Esports. These benefits combine hard skills,
                soft skills, and social benefits, which are accessible to people of all ages!
                Although some Esports have gotten bad press recently, it would be amiss to suggest they offer no
                benefits/advantages to their players and communities. To illustrate these positives, the following
                benefits/advantages of Esports will be discussed in further detail below:</b></p>

            <h1 class="h1"> Esports Are A Flexible Way To Play Alone Or With Others</h1>
            <p class="para">
            Most of the top Esports like League of Legends and Apex: Legends require teams to work together to secure
            victory. Therefore, this is an excellent way of playing video games for people who enjoy cooperation and
            playing
            with others.
            However, there is a host of other Esports, mainly in the fighting and real-time strategy genres like Street
            Fighter and Starcraft, that allow players to play by themselves. These games are better suited to people who
            prefer developing individual strategies and competing in one vs. one matches.

            <h2 class="h1"> Esports Improve Communication Skills</h2>
        <p class="para">
            Because various Esports require communication between teammates, they are an excellent way to build
            confidence
            and improve one’s communication skills. Furthermore, the community around different Esports allows people to
            make friends and colleagues with like-minded people.

            <h2 class="h1">Esports Improve Quick Thinking Skills</h2>
            <p class="para">
            Although most Esports require players to plan and strategize ahead, many Esports need players to implement
            quick-thinking skills and moves.
            Therefore, Esports reward players that work on improving their decisive problem-solving skills to
            change/alter strategies that may be unsuccessful or that need to be realigned.
            Esports Improve One’s Ability To Remain Calm
            Many Esports can be stressful games where things can quickly fall apart for yourself or your team.
            Therefore, remaining calm throughout a session is essential while playing a game, taking stock if you find
            yourself falling behind.
            In conclusion, Esports help people learn how to stay calm in stressful situations with practice and hard
            work.

            <p class="para">
            Whether you are playing competitively or casually with a group of friends, most Esports have steep learning
            curves and skill ceilings.
            Furthermore, the speed at which Esports are played means that you will inevitably make mistakes that may
            cost you and your team a victory. It takes the best players to remain calm, take stock, and learn from their
            mistakes when they lose.

            <p class="para">
                Since their growing popularity in the 21st century, Esports leagues are doing their best to promote
            professionalism and sportsmanship among their communities, similar to traditional sports leagues.
            Consequently, Esports are an excellent space to develop a sense of sportsmanship and team camaraderie.
            Furthermore, Esports teaches players the importance of respect in defeat and humility in victory.

        <section class="p1">
            <h2 class="h1">Esports Teach Persistence And Patience</h2>
            <p class="para">
            Because most Esports have a high skill ceiling and learning curve, players need to be patient and persistent
            when developing their skills, as it’s unlikely that they will be competitive without tenacity and hard work.
            Furthermore, while some Esports are action-packed and fast-paced, other games are long-drawn-out affairs,
            where remaining focused for long periods is the sign of a top player.

            <h2 class="h1">Improve One’s Spatial Awareness</h2>
            <p class="para">
            Whether you play an Esport that requires spatial awareness on a micro-level, such as knowing hitboxes in
            fighting games, or on a macro-level, such as map awareness in real-time strategy games, all Esports require
            players to have a detailed understanding of their surroundings. Esports Teach The Importance Of Practice
            A critical difference between traditional sports and esports is the tendency for Esports to drastically
            change from season to season. Top Esports usually change mechanics, variables, rules, and regulations
            through patch notes.
            These constant changes do consistent practice, and keeping up with the news is vital for competitive
            Esports.

            <p class="para">
            Most traditional sports are inaccessible to many people with disabilities, limited funds, or reduced
            coordination. Therefore, Esports is an excellent avenue for people to access sport and competition that
            doesn’t require travel or extensive financial investment and is more accommodating to people with physical
            disabilities.

            E-sports can be a potential career path for many players. Although most top earners are professional
            athletes, there are also many roles Esports stakeholders can follow.

            <p class="para">
            Because Esports are mostly played online and can be enjoyed without the need for “small talk,” many
            neurodivergent people have found Esports and their communities to be safe and inviting spaces.
            Although there are still issues regarding “toxic” Esports communities, many leagues and developers are
            putting measures in place to reduce instances of cyberbullying and other harmful player interactions.

            Fast-paced video game genres such as first-person shooters or fighting games require twitch reflexes and
            advanced hand-eye coordination to succeed in competitive Esports.
            Nearly all genres of Esports, even one’s you wouldn’t expect, like MOBAs, have been shown to improve
            players’ reflexes over time.

            While Esports that require a nuanced understanding of multiple systems, such as the role of resource
            management and population caps in real-time strategy games, are the most common example of problem-solving
            skills in action.
            Most Esports require problem-solving before, during, and after gaming sessions to allow players to preempt
            opposing strategies, adapt existing strategies, and re-valuate their plays after a gaming session during
            debriefing.
